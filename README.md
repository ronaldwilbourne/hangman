 Prompt user to enter word and store it into a character array.
 Initiate another array of same length as word, but each character is an “_”.
 Prompt user to guess a letter a through z.
 For loop: number of iterations = length of word
 For each iteration, test whether the character entered by the player matches
 the letter of the number of the current iteration.
End the loop.
 If Condition 1: check whether any letters matched,
 Else if: If letters do match,
 replace the “_” with said letter.
 If condition 2: check whether new string is equal to original word
 If true  end loop
 If condition 3: Check whether lives = 0
 If true, print “You lose” & end loop
 End while loop
